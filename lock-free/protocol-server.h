     *
     * These hooks are only relevent when reading or writing from the socket
     * using the server functions (such as  `Server.read` and `Server.write`).
     *
     * These hooks are attached to the specified socket and they are cleared
     * automatically once the connection is closed.
     *
     * **Writing hook**
     *
     * A writing hook will be used instead of the `write` function to send
     * data to the socket. This allows uses the buffer for special protocol
     * extension or transport layers, such as SSL/TLS instead of buffering
     * data to the network.
     *
     * A writing hook is a function that takes in a pointer to the server
     * (the buffer's owner), the socket to which writing should be performed
     * (fd), a pointer to the data to be written and the length of the data
     * to be written:
     *
     * A writing hook should return the number of bytes actually sent from
     * the data buffer (not the number of bytes sent through the socket,
     * but the number of bytes that can be marked as sent).
     *
     * A writing hook should return -1 if the data couldn't be sent and
     * processing should be stop (the connection was lost or suffered a
     * fatal error).
     *
     * A writing hook should return 0 if no data was sent, but the
     * connection should remain open or no fatal error occured.
     *
     * A writing hook MUST write data to the network, or it will not be
     * called again until new data becomes available through
     * `Server.write` (meanning, it might never get called again).
     * Returning a positive value without writing data to the network will
     * NOT cause the writing hook to be called again.
     * That is:
     * @code
     *   ssize_t writing_hook(server_pt srv, int fd,
     *                        void *data, size_t len) {
     *     int sent = write(fd, data, len);
     *     if (sent < 0 && (errno & (EWOULDBLOCK | EAGAIN | EINTR)))
     *       sent = 0;
     *     return sent;
     *   }
     * @endcode
     *
     * **Reading hook**
     *
     * The reading hook, similar to the writing hook, should behave the
     * same as `read` and accepts the same arguments as the `writing_hook`,
     * except the `length` argument should reffer to the size of the buffer
     * (or the amount of data to be read, if less then the size of the
     * buffer).
     *
     * The return values are the same as the writing hook's return values,
     * except the number of bytes returned refers to the number of bytes
     * written to the buffer.
     * That is:
     * @code
     *   ssize_t reading_hook(server_pt srv, int fd,
     *                        void *buffer, size_t size) {
     *     ssize_t read = 0;
