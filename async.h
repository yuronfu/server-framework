 * \brief A simple thread pool utilizing POSIX threads
 *
 * The thread pool can take any function and split it across a set number
 * of threads. It uses a combination of a pipe (for wakeup signals) and
 * mutexes (for managing the task queue) to give a basic layer of protection
 * to any server implementation.
 *
 * The Async global object allows us access to the Async thread pool API.
 *
 * Use:
 * @code
 *   async_p async = Async.create(4); // 4 worker threads
 *   Async.finish(async); // signal and wait, then the object self-destructs
 * @endcode
 *
 * @note The implementation is not fork-friendly. In general, mixing `fork`
 *       with multi-threading is not safe nor trivial - always fork before
 *       multi-threading.
